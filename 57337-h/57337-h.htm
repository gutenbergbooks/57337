<span class="fsz4">T</span>HE
recent revival of this
interesting game has resulted in the application of modern principles
of system and exactness to Alleys, Pins, and Balls. What would have
been very good ten years ago will not answer at all now. The alley in
particular must be right from the start and remain so. This can only
be expected of experienced builders, using first class materials. We
have been building alleys for ten years and by giving them careful
study have produced good alleys. This catalogue describes them in every
detail. There are alleys and ALLEYS, but there is only one “STANDARD”
ALLEY. The statements we make regarding it are facts, borne out by the
class of people who use it.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">CONSTRUCTION.</em> The beds rest on sleepers supported at their ends by
sills running the entire length of the alleys. These may rest on a
concrete, cement, or other solid floor, or on posts or piers set 8 ft.
apart, or where the ground is firm and dry of a gravelly nature, on
flat stones laid on the ground. The sills raise both sleepers and bed
clear of the ground or cement, and as there is ample air space beneath
them they are not liable to be affected by moisture which nearly always
collects in confined places near the ground. The beds are made of
strips three inches wide, tongued and grooved on the sides, (see page
14) and are built up by nailing and glueing each strip on top of the
preceding one until the bed stands on edge 42 inches high: in this way
the strips are firmly driven together and a solid bed secured. The bed
is then laid down, screwed to the sleepers and planed.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">DURABILITY.</em> This is secured, first by the use of good well-seasoned
timber. Second by the ample air space beneath the alleys. As we use
large quantities of the Hard White Maple of which the beds are made,
we have arranged with several of the largest mills in the country
to select from their finest stock the best for our use, shipping in
car-load lots. No such timber can be found in any city yards. The
Sills and Sleepers are of Selected Hard Pine, known as one of the
most durable woods. As none of the woodwork is bedded in cement or
in any way closed up there is no tendency to dry rot, and it cannot
be affected by any ordinary degree of moisture. By long experience
in alley building we have ascertained the most durable materials for
different parts and their best forms, features that save wear and avoid
early and expensive repairs.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>The Standard (Reiskey &amp; Wolf Patent) Adjustable Alleys are
con­struct­ed in every de­tail the same as the Standard Bowling Alleys
except that the sleepers on which the beds rest are adjustable. The
adjusting screws are placed at the ends of the sleepers and rest on the
sills as shown above. They are riveted to Iron Shoes that are secured
to the sills so that the screws can raise up or draw down the beds. Any
deviations of the beds from level, except such as are due to wear, may
be corrected by the adjusting screws, and the expense of re-planing
avoided or reduced in cost. When it is necessary to plane out a worn
spot the worn part may be raised by the screws and the necessity of
taking a deep cut of the whole bed avoided.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">SECTIONAL ALLEYS.</em> On the Adjustable principle
we build sectional Alleys with the beds in sections 12 to 14 feet long
and 42 inches wide. After the Adjustable Sleepers are set and leveled,
the bed sections are screwed to them and if necessary again leveled by
the adjusting screws. Such alleys are as near portable as it has been
possible to get alleys and may be moved from Winter to Summer resorts,
etc.</p></div><!--section-->

<h2 class="h2-a">ADVANTAGES.</h2>

<hr class="hr20" />

<p>The following claims are made for the “STANDARD”
Bowling Alleys, and have been sustained
by use:</p>

<p><em class="emibu">KEEP LEVEL.</em> On account of the air space
underneath them, which is ventilated by openings,
the beds are less affected by moisture rising from
the ground, cement, etc.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">SURFACE.</em> The bed being glued up of strips
having rabbets cut on the sides, form a solid bed
in which no piece can get loose, slip, raise up, or
give any trouble.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">FOUNDATIONS.</em> Practically, no foundation
is required; hence, a great saving is effected.
The sills can be laid on a tar concrete or cement
floor, or on piers or posts set three feet in the
ground. All sills are supplied by us. As no
part of the foundation is buried in cement, it lasts
indefinitely.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">WEAR AND TEAR.</em> By long experience we
have ascertained the best materials and forms to
stand the severe usage of public and club alleys
and by their use avoid the vexatious break-downs
formerly so common on alleys.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">EXPERIENCE.</em> As we build a great many
alleys our workmen are accustomed to the work
and know its requirements. Our alleys are not
experiments; they are tried and proved successes.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">DURABILITY.</em> The beds being made of double
kiln dried White Rock Maple, last longer and
do not require so much re-planing as if made of
softer woods or maple as ordinarily seasoned.</p>

<p><em class="emibu">RE-PLANING.</em> The strips of which the beds
are made do not dry out and have cracks between
them that fill with grit and make re-planing almost
impossible.</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="pfirst"><span class="fsz4">M</span>APLE
is unquestionably the best wood for alley beds. It is hard,
white, durable, even grained and when properly seasoned and
dried, will remain as laid without shrinking or warping. That is, the
best maple will do all this. We are large buyers of maple for alleys and
other purposes, and get direct from the mills the highest grade of Hard, White
(Rock) Maple. Such stock as is never carried by city yards—they have no
call for it. This fine stock enables us to build alley beds that are clear
white from end to end, without spots or streaks, level and true. The ideal
bowling surfaces.</p>

Posts and runs are an in­no­va­tion we in­tro­duced three or four years ago.
Their ad­van­tages were ap­parent from the start and now no­thing else will be
tol­er­ated. They give both play­ers and spec­tators an unob­struct­ed view of the alley
beds and pins. In a room con­tain­ing eight or ten alleys, one can see every pin.
The runs are strong, the posts being
short, and as the balls do not have
to be raised so high to put them in
the cage they are dropped in easier and
wear longer.</p>

<h2 class="h2-b">DESCRIPTION.</h2>
<hr class="hr20" />
<p>The runs are low with a low post placed inside of the scratch line. These alleys conform
in every detail to the Regulations of the Massachusetts Amateur Bowling League, which are
generally adopted by other Eastern organizations.</p>

<p>The pit is four feet wide and is dropped well below the beds so that balls go over pins
or balls lying in the pit.</p>

<p>The swinging bunters are large, heavy, and well padded with a durable palm fibre, the padding
being in sections to prevent its packing down in the bottom of the bunter. The bottom
and sides of the pit are padded, and from opposite the head-pin to one foot beyond the beds,
the sides, where the flying pins strike, are covered with sole leather.</p>

<p>The ball cage and the first section of the runs are made of hickory to stand the severe
use.</p>

<p>Tonguing and grooving alley stock is a feature we introduced several
years ago—long enough to have given it a good test. A bed built this
way, especially when glued and well nailed with cut steel nails, as
ours are, is a solid plank from end to end with the tendency to warp
removed by the strips having their grain in various directions. Loose
or split ends that rise up and turn balls aside are an impossibility,
and so close are the boards drawn to each other that it is almost
impossible to find the joints. Thus the dirt is kept from working
between the boards and forming unsightly cracks which let in water,
when the alleys are washed, to work still more destruction.</p>

the material and workmanship on all our alleys to be
first-class in every respect and will repair free of charge, for one
year, any breakage due to faulty construction or defective material;
but we cannot guarantee against the natural effect of heat and moisture
on the stock out of which the alleys are laid.</p>

<hr class="hr20" />
<p class="fsz7">EXPERIENCE is a very necessary factor in building Bowling Alleys. For
six years we built alleys according to the old method of setting the
sleepers in cement, nailing the beds to them, etc., and though we took
great care to have all work and materials first-class, our alleys did
not always give the perfect satisfaction we desired. To obviate some
of the troubles, in 1892 we introduced the Reisky &amp; Wolf adjustable
alleys with improvements in the construction of the beds, etc., and
later the Standard non-adjustable alleys built on the same general
principles. These alleys have given such excellent satisfaction
that our business has largely increased, and we are confident that
every alley we build according to our new method will give perfect
satisfaction.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>Some means for retarding or reducing the speed of returned
balls is an absolute necessity, otherwise they crash into each
other making a disagreeable noise, injure the balls and knock
the smaller ones off the runs. When taking a ball off the runs
bowlers have often had their fingers badly crushed by a swiftly
returned ball.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dctr03"><img src="images/i024a.jpg"
width="600" height="385" alt="" /></div>

<p>It is desirable to return balls as swiftly as possible to save
time and get a favorite ball back without delay.</p>

<p>The retarder shown above was invented by a bowler and is
perfection itself in operation. The resistance is greater for
large and swift balls, and very little on slow or small balls.
The resistance is affected by the air chamber under the short
end of the lever which has an outlet for the compressed air
controlled by a set screw so it can be adjusted. The long end
of the lever has a wooden shoe with leather on the under side.
A large ball raises this shoe high, compressing the air, a quick
ball raises it quickly and is resisted by the compressed air which
can only escape slowly. A small quick ball raises the shoe a
short distance quickly and is held back by the shoe while a small
slow ball passes under with scarcely any resistance.</p>

<p>The retarder will save its cost in the wear of the balls in a
single year and give comfort and safety to the bowlers. It can
be secured to any runway about 10 feet from the post in a few
minutes, screws being sent with each retarder.</p>

<p>The necessary dimensions for “Regulation” Bowling Alleys are given on
the blue print bound in opposite this page. The required space should
be absolutely free from columns, piers, pipes, etc. Any such projection
will prevent the alleys from being full “Regulation” size as required
in match games. More space at the end of the “Run” for spectators is
desirable, but not necessary. A space 5 ft. wide and 6 in. deep for the
pit should be provided; the rest of the floor or ground should be level
as shown in section on the blue print.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
